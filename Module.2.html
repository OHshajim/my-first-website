        A planet is a large, rounded astronomical body that is neither a star nor its remnant. The best available theory of planet formation is the nebular hypothesis, which posits that an interstellar cloud collapses out of a nebula to create a young protostar orbited by a protoplanetary disk. Planets grow in this disk by the gradual accumulation of material driven by gravity, a process called accretion. The Solar System has at least eight planets: the terrestrial planets <span id="nameofp"> Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, and the giant planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune</span>. These planets each rotate around an axis tilted with respect to its orbital pole. All the major planets of the Solar System other than Mercury possess a considerable atmosphere, and some share such features as  caps, seasons, volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics, and even hydrology  . Apart from Venus and Mars, the Solar System planets generate magnetic fields, and all the major planets except Venus and Mercury have natural satellites. The giant planets bear planetary rings, the most prominent being those of Saturn.

        A planet is any relatively large natural body that revolves in an orbit around the Sun or around some other star and that is not radiating energy from internal nuclear fusion reactions. In addition to the above description, some scientists impose additional constraints regarding characteristics such as size, shape, or mass. As the term is applied to bodies in Earthâ€™s solar system, the International Astronomical Union  lists eight planets orbiting the Sun. Pluto also was listed as a planet until 2006. This is a list of selected planets.

    <p style="font-style: italic;  ;padding: 10px;"><!--inline -->
         The 2006 IAU definition presents some challenges for exoplanets because the language is specific to the Solar System and the criteria of roundness and orbital zone clearance are not presently observable for exoplanets.The IAU working group on extrasolar planets  issued a working definition in 2001 and amended it in 2003. In 2018, this definition was reassessed and updated as knowledge of exoplanets increased. The current official working definition of an exoplanet is as follows. 

       <div >
            1. Objects with true masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium  that orbit stars, brown dwarfs, or stellar remnants and that have a mass ratio with the central object below the L4/L5 instability are "planets" . The minimum mass/size required for an extrasolar object to be considered a planet should be the same as that used in our Solar System.
        </div>
       <div>
           2. Substellar objects with true masses above the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are "brown dwarfs", no matter how they formed nor where they are located.
             Free-floating objects in young star clusters with masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are not "planets", but are "sub-brown dwarfs"
