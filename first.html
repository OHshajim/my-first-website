            <small>Welcome to my travel blog</small>, <em>Love Travelling</em>. I’m Shajim, an award winning independent
            traveller writing about my visits to countries near and far.I research destinations myself and that’s part
            of the fun visiting the local library and selecting some travel guides, looking things up online and, of
            course, all the amazing tips I discover from fellow <strong>travel bloggers</strong>.The world is a book and
            those who do not travel read only one page. Augustine of Hippo . My passion is travel, I just love visiting
            new places, immersing myself into local cultures of life around the world and discovering the unexpected!
            Stepping off a plane, I’m always in a hurry to get my passport stamped, reclaim my luggage and walk out of
            the arrivals hall ready to begin a new adventure. I love the planning, the anticipation, the journey, be it
            by plane, train, bus or boat and of course, the actual holiday and finally all the wonderful memories and
            experiences I bring home that live with me forever. That was the original reason why I created this blog so
            that I could have an online diary of my recent trips to look back on in the future. I’ve been surprised but
            thrilled that so many of you have taken an interest in my travels and enjoy reading about my trips it’s very
            encouraging and makes me very happy! From starting as a hobby my blog has evolved into an award winning
            online travel resource providing inspiration to fellow travellers.<button>Read more</button>
